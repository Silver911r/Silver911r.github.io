My name is RJ Simpson and I'm a builder, hacker, backend engineer, investor. I'm from the U.S., living in New England and currently working on my own stuff. You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/Silver911r) or on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Silver911r).

On this page you will find information about me, posts I wrote, things if find interesting. I'm interested in technology and how it influences our lives. Tech that interests me ranges from satellite communication, single board computers, to software security, containers, python and even php.
